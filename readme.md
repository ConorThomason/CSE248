**CSE248 Garage Management Final Project - Conor Thomason**

This project is representative of my interpretation of a parking garage being managed through an Android interface. It uses a singleton data structure to allow Garage and EmployeeManagement to be called from anywhere, by utilizing Application to keep it running in the background throughout the app running.

UML Diagrams and Burndowns are representative of my initial views of the project; my initial interpretation of the project was that android studio would be similar to SceneBuilder; while this is true for the drag and drop aspect, the controller aspect was extremely dissimilar.

For future improvements, I think time management is a key learning point that can be gained through experience. I would have liked the opportunity to implement TimeControl, a class dedicated to the manipulation of the rates through accelerating time, or a vehicle search, which would have allowed RecyclerView to bring the searched license plate to the forefront. It is extremely difficult to budget and allocate time appropriately for a task you (at the time) know nothing about.
